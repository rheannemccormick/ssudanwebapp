The Office of SPLA Spokesperson takes this opportunity to inform our Gallant Forces and the people of South Sudan that Jonglei Operation under the overall Command of Lt. Gen. Malual Ayom Dor had conducted a very successful Infiltration Mission at enemy's rear in Mototo village after actionable intelligence indicated presence of stationary air defense weaponry. The mission succeeded in capturing:
1. One Zuu 23 
2. Two 12.7 heavy machine guns 
3. One Long Range Radio and 
4. One Satellite Phone (Thuraya)

Remarks:

• Your Excellency, Ato Haile Merriam Desalegn, Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Hon Ministers, Distinguished ladies and gentlemen.
 
• Please allow me to extend my warm deep appreciation and gratitude for the kind invitation for me and my delegation to visit Ethiopia and hold talks with the leadership of this country.
 
• The 8 Agreements or/and Memoranda of Understanding which we signed this morning will go a long way in further strengthening our bilateral relations. These relations are already excellent but our ambition is to take them to a level where the ordinary citizens in our two sisterly countries will feel and practically benefit from the improvement of our two economies and thus lift the standard of livelihood of our people.
 
• I wish to thank Your Excellency for these memoranda especially the construction of the two roads. All these efforts will be mutually beneficial to all our citizens in the two countries. South Sudan earnestly needs infrastructure and these roads will give access to our people in term of mobility. And in turn Your Excellency, our top priority in these memoranda is to build the refinery so that our brothers from Ethiopia will have a ready source of refined fuel close to them and that will help in boosting their economic activities. We will make sure this is realized as soon as possible so that our citizens reap the benefits that we promised them.
 
• Mr. Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, we in South Sudan will never get tired of appreciating the role Ethiopia has played through its successive governments in our historical development, going as far back as the first peace agreement in 1972 – well-known as Addis Ababa Agreement. His Highness Emperor, Haile Selassie stood firmly on the side of the then marginalized people of Southern Sudan to make sure that our aspirations were not stifled. When his government was overthrown by the Marxists in 1974, the cause of the people of Southern Sudan was not discarded by Mengistu's regime and this continue even after Marxists regime, our brothers in TPLF/EPRDF continue to support us through thick and thin. Your predecessor, Late Meles Zenawi was exemplary even went beyond what the Emperor and Mengistu did to the people of South Sudan. He made sure that the voices of the people of South Sudan were heard of and pushed further to have CPA negotiated and signed. Cognisant of the Late Zenawi's support, Your Excellency did not leave any stone unturned once you succeed him. You vigorously resisted Western Powers' push to have South Sudan strangled through sanctions and arms embargo by making sure that you did not allow them to use IGAD to blackmail South Sudan. Such brotherly support continues until the just concluded Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCISS) in 2015.
 
• Although we have recently experienced a setback, we are determined to fully implement the Peace Agreement under the auspices of the Transitional Government of National Unity. So we call upon Your Excellency, Prime Minister, to continue supporting not only our efforts in this regard but also our appeals to the region and the international community to lend us both political and material support. This appeal should be combined with the call to the region and international community to help avert the humanitarian catastrophe that will befall large numbers of the population in the Horn of Africa Region as a result of the current drought which has already triggered the onset of famine.
 
• Your Excellency, I appreciate very much your genuine support of the National Dialogue process which I announced in the middle of December 2016.
 
- Contrary to the claims of our detractors and enemies of peace and stability in my country that it will undermine the implementation of the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, I wish to assure Your Excellency that it will actually enhance the implementation of the Agreement and consolidate peace and stability in country.
- This National Dialogue will be inclusive and will reach all corners of our country and involve all our ethnic communities in every single state.
- It will give our people the support to articulate their grievances and propose solutions to them without being dictated by elites.
- It will be a grassroots exercise from bottom to top.
 
• Mr. Prime Minister, I wish to assure you that our relations are not just good neighborly relations; they are relations anchored on blood fraternity and a long history of peaceful coexistence that has never been tainted by violence or even fugitive animosity. Those who are scheming day and night to poison these relations will therefore fail miserably. Any weakness in our bilateral relations will only be attributable to our non-implementation of what we have committed ourselves to do or observe under the Agreement or Memoranda of Understanding we signed today and any others previously concluded.
 
• Your Excellency, I want to assure you that South Sudan will not be used by any force to destabilize this great nation. Your unwavering support to the people and government of South Sudan for the last 4 years in search of peace is something that we all stand to appreciate rather than allowing it to be destroyed.
 
• As we return to Juba tomorrow with full package and clear timeline on what to do as per our agreements, I want to reiterate that South Sudan is very much determined to execute its part in these Memoranda we have just signed. We pray God Almighty to give you good health to continue to lead Ethiopia efficiently and to wish our brothers and sisters in your great country prosperity, good health and happiness.
 
• May you all enjoy your dinner and have a comfortable night.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/southsudan.news/photos/a.239725489495981.63382.238276116307585/990625924405930/?type=3,2017-02-25 08:38:25,29,12,8,29,0,0,0,0,0

Ugandan gold refinery to import from conflict-ridden South Sudan, Congo
Tue Feb 21, 2017
By Elias Biryabarema,
KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's first gold refinery, which opened on Monday, will use raw gold from conflict-ridden South Sudan and Eastern Congo, its owner Africa Gold Refinery said, dismissing activists' concerns that such a move could fuel violence in the region.
The refinery, which is in Entebbe, south of the capital Kampala, will process raw gold from the region as Uganda has only small mines and no commercial mine.
Rights activists, however, are concerned about the use of gold from conflict areas such as the volatile mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, mired in civil war.
""Gold which is used to finance conflict might be finding its way into supply chains,"" said George Boden, an activist at London-based rights group Global Witness.
A U.S. law passed in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act, requires companies to disclose whether their products contain minerals from conflict-ridden parts of Africa. The law aims to hinder armed groups from using minerals to finance conflicts.
""It's a very high compliance refinery. We do due diligence for every customer who comes in,"" Alain Goetz, the chief executive officer of Africa Gold Refinery (AGR), told Reuters.
Goetz is AGR's majority shareholder and he also owns a stake in Belgian gold refiner Tony Goetz NV.
He said AGR would carefully select its customers, comply with the law and label its gold accordingly.
""Of course we want to sell to American companies, we will sell to American companies. With the compliance and the third party auditing, we'll comply with all the regulations ... including labelling,"" Goetz said.
Uganda has been keen to attract investors to its mining sector after government surveys established the existence of minerals including gold, base metals, uranium, rare earths, iron, titanium, vermiculite, diamond in various locations.
The factory has an initial output capacity of 300 kilogrammes of pure gold per week, and the ability to increase that to 500 kilograms eventually. Goetz said the gold will be used for coins and jewellery.
Between mid-2009 and mid-2015, Uganda's annual gold exports fluctuated between near zero to just under $40 million, according to central bank data.
Exports rocketed to $204 million in the last financial year, ended in July 2016. Boden said the sudden jump could be due in part to gold smuggled from neighbouring countries and being exported from Uganda.

JUBA (18 Feb.)
South Sudan government has confirmed the resignation of Minister of Labour, Public Service and Human Resource Development Gabriel Duop Lam after media reports surfaced of his resignation on Friday morning.
Lt. Gen. Gabriel Duop Lam, who was a senior member of the SPLM-IO faction allied to First Vice President Taban Deng in Juba, was the labour minister in the unity government in Juba.
Speaking to reporters in Juba on Friday, Michael Makuei Lueth, Minister of Information said: ""The Minister of Labour, Public Service and Human Resource Development, Mr. Gabriel Duop Lam, has defected, and earlier of course, as you know his deputy defected. So, the Ministry of Public Service at present is being run by the undersecretary.""
Makuei further said the SPLM-IO leadership in Juba will issue a press statement on the resignation of Gen. Gabriel Duop from the unity government.
The labour ministry was given to the SPLM-IO when South Sudan's government, rebels, former detainees, and other political parties, divided up the ministries for the country's transitional power-sharing government in line with the 2015 peace deal.
In a resignation letter on Friday, Gebrial Duop Lam, cited frustration with the unity government's inability to tackle the country's problems.

Dear all,
I would like to comment on the new political trends in South Sudan🇸🇸.
Nothing else than the Incumbent city transfer from Juba to Ramciel (proposed city of SSD). As a citizen of this nation, I have all the privileges and rights to express my views and opinions on anything that may concern South Sudan in accordance to the federal constitution of the Republic Of South Sudan (Justice, liberty and prosperity for ALL, See South Sudan eagle logo for quick reference). Therefore in my own opinion on the wiretap to the current development in South Sudan city's relocation from Juba to Ramciel is a great idea, I have always wanted and demanded it. I'm so pleased that it has been brought to table recently. The location of Ramciel in the hub of South Sudan and Africa in a large extent do give all citizens of South Sudan that it may concern to clamor and claim it to be the next city of South Sudan and Africa's business hub with out any kind of skepticism. The only sceptics I knew would be 'how South Sudan government will manage to meet the sum of monies needed to build the brand new city Modernly'. On the other transparency, I do see that as something miner and can be well solved by requesting an indebted from China, US, or world bank, you mention it. Besides that, is security concern, the insecurity in the country is still proliferating to a higher rate (outside Juba) in a every single day. How about if we could met security stability first? Before we could transfer to Ramciel?. In a few words conclusion, it will be one among the great ideas from the people of South Sudan especially, H.E Mr. President Gen. Kiir. We shall forever be grateful to this move in the history of our country if the authority will not repeal the public clamor.

Juba- diplomatic row has broken out between South Sudan and neighbouring Ethiopia following rumours on social media that President Salva Kiir accepted to allow Ethiopian rebels to open their office in the capital Juba.

""Rumours have been circulating on social media that when President Kiir visited Egypt, he discussed import issues with the Egyptian officials so that Ethiopian rebels can open an office in Juba, ""a senior government official who preferred anonymity told Radio Tamazuj today.

""The rumours circulated that the President has accepted to allow the Ethiopian rebels to open their office in Juba and Egypt will support the Ethiopian rebels with guns, because Egypt is having differences with Ethiopia over the issue of Renaissance Dam, so this is what happened on social media,"" he added.

The official accused the SPLM-IO faction allied to former First Vice President Riek Machar of circulating the rumour in neighbouring Ethiopia.""The rebels now took advantage of that, and this information has already reached the government of Ethiopia,"" he said.

He pointed out that the government of Ethiopia has decided to cut diplomatic ties with the government of South Sudan and expel South Sudan's Ambassador to Addis Ababa.

""Even if there are differences between us, Ethiopia cannot expel our ambassador, because the ambassador is the ambassador of South Sudan to Ethiopia and at the same time he is representing us in the African Union. So, Ethiopia cannot expel our ambassador,"" he said.

Eyewitnesses says many passengers were killed yesterday morning after a vehicle travelling to Juba from Yei came under attack near Lainya. The vehicle was carrying over 200 people. 

Eyewitnesses said that the attackers were masked when they attacked the vehicle. Few people jumped out of the vehicle and ran into the bush when the lorry came to a halt. Afterwards the gunmen systematically started separating people of Dinka ethnicity from others by asking people whether they are Dinkas or not. They then executed all the Dinkas including women and children and then burnt the vehicle. 

Among the dead were Four children who were 13, 11, 8 and 7 years old. The bodies of the children have been brought to Juba. Many of the bodies have not yet been recovered and the exact number of the people who died among the 200 passengers has not yet been ascertained.

Many of the dead are from Paweny, and Ngok-Lual-Yak. The vehicle was attacked few kilometres outside Lainya.

The incident comes after 14 Dinkas were killed in a similar ambush a week ago just few kilometres outside Juba.

Copied from Ambassador Gordon Bay. 

Machar's state of mind will be unstable due to his rejection by the Nuer 

Dear all,

I think Riek Machar will run mad soon because the speed of Nuer defections to Gen. Taban Deng is faster than the speed of a bullet. First, the Nuer in Ethiopia declared their defection followed by Egypt and now by the Nuer in Uganda.

In Khartoum, Gen. Simon Gatwec, Gen. James Koang and 1st Lt. Gen. Gordon Koang made their positions clear that they would negotiate with the FVP, Gen. Taban Deng Gai.

In Nairobi, Gen. Jundi Iraq is already in talks with the government and may be in Juba soon.

If all the remaining Nuer IO Generals are in the process to talk to Gen. Taban, then, Riek Machar will remain with Angelina, Becky and Nyaluak.

I am quite sure Riek Machar will kill himself this year because losing power in a short period like this leads to mental illness most of the times. Gen. Siad Bare and Zairian President Obutu Seseseko died shortly after they were deposed from power. 

Riek Machar is addicted to power and exploitation of the Nuer. He has been in spotlight since 1991 and has been moving from place to place claiming to be a leader. Now that the Nuer rejected him, his mental health will not be the same again.
