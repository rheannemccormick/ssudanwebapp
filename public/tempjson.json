    "status_message": "#SSNBreaking\nUgandan gold refinery to import from conflict-ridden South Sudan, Congo\nTue Feb 21, 2017\nBy Elias Biryabarema,\nKAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's first gold refinery, which opened on Monday, will use raw gold from conflict-ridden South Sudan and Eastern Congo, its owner Africa Gold Refinery said, dismissing activists' concerns that such a move could fuel violence in the region.\nThe refinery, which is in Entebbe, south of the capital Kampala, will process raw gold from the region as Uganda has only small mines and no commercial mine.\nRights activists, however, are concerned about the use of gold from conflict areas such as the volatile mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, mired in civil war.\n\"Gold which is used to finance conflict might be finding its way into supply chains,\" said George Boden, an activist at London-based rights group Global Witness.\nA U.S. law passed in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act, requires companies to disclose whether their products contain minerals from conflict-ridden parts of Africa. The law aims to hinder armed groups from using minerals to finance conflicts.\n\"It's a very high compliance refinery. We do due diligence for every customer who comes in,\" Alain Goetz, the chief executive officer of Africa Gold Refinery (AGR), told Reuters.\nGoetz is AGR's majority shareholder and he also owns a stake in Belgian gold refiner Tony Goetz NV.\nHe said AGR would carefully select its customers, comply with the law and label its gold accordingly.\n\"Of course we want to sell to American companies, we will sell to American companies. With the compliance and the third party auditing, we'll comply with all the regulations ... including labelling,\" Goetz said.\nUganda has been keen to attract investors to its mining sector after government surveys established the existence of minerals including gold, base metals, uranium, rare earths, iron, titanium, vermiculite, diamond in various locations.\nThe factory has an initial output capacity of 300 kilogrammes of pure gold per week, and the ability to increase that to 500 kilograms eventually. Goetz said the gold will be used for coins and jewellery.\nBetween mid-2009 and mid-2015, Uganda's annual gold exports fluctuated between near zero to just under $40 million, according to central bank data.\nExports rocketed to $204 million in the last financial year, ended in July 2016. Boden said the sudden jump could be due in part to gold smuggled from neighbouring countries and being exported from Uganda. (Editing by Katharine Houreld and Susan Fenton)",

As a citizen of this nation, I have all the privileges and rights to express my views and opinions on anything that may concern South Sudan in accordance to the federal constitution of the Republic Of South Sudan (Justice, liberty and prosperity for ALL, See South Sudan eagle logo for quick reference). Therefore in my own opinion on the wiretap to the current development in South Sudan city's relocation from Juba to Ramciel is a great idea, I have always wanted and demanded it. I'm so pleased that it has been brought to table recently. The location of Ramciel in the hub of South Sudan and Africa in a large extent do give all citizens of South Sudan that it may concern to clamor and claim it to be the next city of South Sudan and Africa's business hub with out any kind of skepticism. The only sceptics I knew would be 'how South Sudan government will manage to meet the sum of monies needed to build the brand new city Modernly'. On the other transparency, I do see that as something miner and can be well solved by requesting an indebted from China, US, or world bank, you mention it. Besides that, is security concern, the insecurity in the country is still proliferating to a higher rate (outside Juba) in a every single day. How about if we could met security stability first? Before we could transfer to Ramciel?. In a few words conclusion, it will be one among the great ideas from the people of South Sudan especially, H.E Mr. President Gen. Kiir. We shall forever be grateful to this move in the history of our country if the authority will not repeal the public clamor.\n#PublicOpinions #SouthSudan #RamcielNextCity (hashtags your opinion with either of the three hashtags and we shall publish it as well) \n.\nBy Mangok Aliap Chawul.\nThe Author (Mr. Mangok) is a student with enormous development potential.",

Taban Deng is faster than the speed of a bullet. First, the Nuer in Ethiopia declared their defection followed by Egypt and now by the Nuer in Uganda.\n\nIn Khartoum, Gen. Simon Gatwec, Gen. James Koang and 1st Lt. Gen. Gordon Koang made their positions clear that they would negotiate with the FVP, Gen. Taban Deng Gai.\n\nIn Nairobi, Gen. Jundi Iraq is already in talks with the government and may be in Juba soon.\n\nIf all the remaining Nuer IO Generals are in the process to talk to Gen. Taban, then, Riek Machar will remain with Angelina, Becky and Nyaluak.\n\nI am quite sure Riek Machar will kill himself this year because losing power in a short period like this leads to mental illness most of the times. Gen. Siad Bare and Zairian President Obutu Seseseko died shortly after they were deposed from power. \n\nRiek Machar is addicted to power and exploitation of the Nuer. He has been in spotlight since 1991 and has been moving from place to place claiming to be a leader. Now that the Nuer rejected him, his mental health will not be the same again.\n\n. \nBy Mangok A.

In August, the council decided to send in an additional 4,000 peacekeepers to South Sudan.\n\nIn prepared remarks, US Ambassador Samantha Power was critical of the government, and said it was not cooperating with the United Nations.\n\n\"The international community is extremely frustrated with the obstruction of UN peacekeeping operations that have gone on too long. It's extremely difficult for the UN to do its work here,\" she said. \"With the poverty and extreme hunger, the international community tried to step up, we need a partner,\"\n\nThe government has accepted in principal the force, but many outright reject it. On Thursday, the US Embassy said that there were reports of protests against the additional peacekeepers in the capital.\n\nThe UN representative from Senegal said that protecting South Sudan's sovereignty was paramount, and highlighted that it was a protection force. \"You accepted in principal the deployment,\" he said. \"This deployment will be done in collaboration with the South Sudanese government,\"\n\nThere are already 12,000 UN peacekeepers in South Sudan.\n\nBut Power said that if South Sudan did not comply with the UN Security Council resolution, than targeted sanctions and an arms embargo were possibilities.\n\n\"People who are operating with impunity don't want to operate with UNMISS and don't want to cooperate with a regional protection force,\" she said.",

Upon arrival, I met the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, with whom we discussed the current situation in South Sudan.\nI am of the view that the following three issues be addressed for peace to return to South Sudan.\nFirst, a regional force should be assembled to protect Vice President Riek Machar who does not trust the SPLA forces under President Salva Kiir.\nSecondly, there must be a cessation of hostilities in Juba. No new fighting should occur.\nThird is the question of elections and democracy. Votes will force the factions into alliances. Democracy will force them to work together. Now, they know that they are not accountable to the people.\nI, however, oppose the suggestion that an arms embargo be placed on South Sudan. It would create a vacuum and plunge the country into more chaos like we saw in Somalia.\nWhat is happening in South Sudan is sectarian politics, where one partisan community is fighting the other. When you impose an arms embargo, you destroy the local force on which you need to build a strong, integrated national army.",

The Chairperson of JMEC has reacted with regret to the reported fighting in Juba, which has not relented in the past two days. He has called on the parties to the conflict to exercise restraint to avoid any further loss of lives and destruction of property.\nH. E. Festus G. Mogae has expressed his condolences to the families of those killed in the renewed fighting. He has also expressed concern at the large numbers of people reportedly being displaced, compounding the dire humanitarian catastrophe that the country faces. \nThe Chairperson of JMEC regrets that failure to respect the permanent ceasefire by the parties would significantly undermine the 2015 Peace Agreement for South Sudan. He expressed his earnest hope that his ongoing efforts to engage President Salva Kiir Mayardit and First Vice President Dr. Riek Machar Teny-Dhurgon will yield positive results, in de-escalating the conflict, and ensuring the expeditious implementation of the Peace Agreement. \nH. E. Festus G. Mogae has appealed to IGAD, AU, UN and the International community to assist South Sudan in every manner possible, during this difficult period, in particular to secure stability and ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of South Sudan.",

Chawul (publisher at SSN) \n\nThe chairman of Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) President Kiir says his party should establish a political school to train SPLM youth and cadres to become vibrant leaders in the country. \nSPLM Youth League Interim National Council organized a meeting that started yesterday 29th june up to 2nd july under the theme: SPLM Youth League stands for peaceful, harmonious and vibrant South Sudan.\nAdressing the SPLM Youth League delegates from the 28states, President Kiir said training for SPLM Youth will enable them develop the party with out the challenges. \n\"You must be trained so that when you are given an SPLM assignment you take it as your personal thing not as something given to you by somebody because now there's reluctance if you give somebody to take over an SPLM assignment they say it is not a paid job. Volunteers or revolutionaries do not mind about what goes to their stomach\", he said. \nHe directed for the SPLM Political School to be opened here in the country. \n\"The training school I'm talking about should be done inside South Sudan not to go to some people's political school. We must establush our own political school here in South Sudan because the failure not establish the school is the 2013 military coup because there are people who led down SPLM by taking money to make their own private projects which has resulted to SPLM not having a centre that's why some of are sitting the hall here,\" he said.\n\"So let us think of to build our school now,\" he added. \nPresident Kiir said people should remain optimistic that things will change despite the economic crisis facing the people of South Sudan during the implementation of what he described as 'a bad peace' in the country.\nHe said some people didn't want him to sign the peace agreement but he decided to sign it to save the lives of South Sudanese.\n\"From 2013, we could not reach a resolution to stop the conflict up to august 2015 and we signed that bad peace here in juba,\" he said.\nHe said although some people did not want him to sign the peace agreement, but he if he did not sign it then what had he been fighting for all this time? \n\"I was fighting for the love of the people. I said if my pen can bring peace back to my people theb I have to do it bur the way it was dilesigned, it could not be easily implemented. \nThis is why we are moving with cautiously and very slowly so that it can not be broken in our hands,\"he said.\nHe said although some people he didn't mention are trying to break the peace agreement, with the support of the SPLM Youth the peace agreement will never be broken.,\n\"There are people who are really trying their best to let it break but with your support as a youth, I would not let it to be broken in our hands,\" he said. \nHe reiterated that the Independence Day will not be celebrated as usual because of the economic crisis in the country.\n\"Because of all this crisis that we have we have we will not celebrate our Independence Day the way we used to do it as the Council of Ministers came up with the decision that it will observed as public holiday and whatever speeches that will be made will not be like every year,\" he said. \n\"If there is a little money that can make us to celebrate, we will keep it for black day for feeding our people,\" he added. \nThe vice president of South Sudan James Wani Igga advised the youth to prepare early for leadership so that they can lead without major challenges. \nHe identified seven qualities of leadership that every young person must learn in order to lead successfully in life. \n\"As a leader in your state, you must be visionary this entails you to plan ahead, for five to ten years ahead and analyze the consequences of your actions now,\" he said. \nHe outlined courage, commitment, selflessness which involves integrity, knowledgeablity, optimism ant patriotism as some of the qualities of leadership that every youth must learn for effective management.",

We strongly condemn the lack of political leadership to resolve this man-made conflict that has exacted a terrible cost over the past nearly 15 months. Along with the many friends and partners of South Sudan, we continue to work closely with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in its efforts to bring an end to this senseless conflict. \n\nThe conflict in South Sudan is a tragedy for its people. A humanitarian catastrophe continues, with more than two million people displaced and what is considered at this time to be the world's worst food security crisis. The entire region is facing economic, security, and humanitarian costs from this conflict. There is no excuse for further fighting, and we will ensure that those who commit acts of violenceâor otherwise undermine efforts toward peaceâare held accountable. We thus look forward to the UN Security Council's planned review of the situation, as called for by Resolution 2206, which the Security Council passed unanimously this week. \n\nToday, the IGAD Chairman called on regional and international partners to work together to reinvigorate the peace process and agree to a common approach toward an end to the crisis. The United States and its Troika partners support vigorous efforts to end this conflict, and will work with IGAD, the African Union, and other international partners to urgently seek a way forward. We must speak with one voice, making clear our collective resolve to assist the South Sudanese people in ending this tragedy.\n#SSN",

The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza in Addis Ababa says the agreement calls for a cessation of hostilities within 24 hours of the signing.  A permanent ceasefire will then be worked on.\n Mr Kiir and Machar are to issue immediate orders for troops to end combat and to allow humanitarian aids. \n It was not immediately clear who would form the transitional administration. \n The deal was also signed by Ethiopian Prime minister Hailemarian Desaglegn, who hosted the talks. Leading mediator Seyoum Mesfin, from the regional Igad bloc, congratulated Mr Kiir and Machar for \"ending the war\".\n However?

    "status_message": "OPINION (views expressed here does not necessarily reflect the position of Talk of Juba):\n\nAnd it is still surprising to some that UNMISS South Sudan is supposedly supporting the rebels or Western Imperialism in South Sudan. Here's a rough something.\n\nLet's recap of what UNMISS South Sudan has been accused of since December 15th:\n\n- UNMISS South Sudan head, Hilde Johnson has been rumoured to have a 'special' relationship with rebel leader, Riek Machar. Furthermore, anti-Hilde Johnson protests broke out in cities such as Kuajok. (Side note - humourously, protesters showed images of Becky Machar with Riek Machar instead of Hilde Johnson on her own or with Riek (if such images even exists)).\n\n- GOSS (Government of South Sudan) has accused (directly and indirectly) the UN of supporting the rebel forces.\n\n- UN Compound did a search which found many offensive weapons within the compound.\n\n- A tribe motivated killing occurred in one of the UN compounds, which UNMISS denied or refused to comment on (last I checked).\n\n- A compound refused the entry of GOSS Minister of Information Makuei Lueth.\n\n- Images of soldiers sporting UN bags circulated the web.\n\n- Most recently, containers labeled UN, filled with weapons, blankets and military uniforms, seized by SPLA and South Sudan police in Rumbek for transit to Bentiu. UNMISS released a statement saying that weapons are usually transferred by air. This does not explain why they have a container, transporting weapons on the ground. But, as a reassurance and somewhat an attempt to maintain credibility, they will 'investigate'.\n\nSo folks. Goodnight.",

Medic peacekeepers from the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS) treat civilians at their compound in the outskirts of South Sudan's capital Juba, in this December 19, 2013 handout provided by UNMISS.\nCREDIT: REUTERS/UNMISS/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS\nRELATED NEWS\nRiek Machar: South Sudan's divisive pretender for power\nAfrican mediators say hold productive talks in South Sudan\n(Reuters) - African mediators said they held productive talks on Friday with South Sudan's President Salva Kiir as they seek to prevent an almost week-long conflict plunging Africa's newest nation into a civil war along ethnic faultlines.\n\nThe United Nations said on Thursday a crowd of Nuer tribesmen breached a U.N. compound in Jonglei State north of the capital and had reports that some locals sheltering there were killed. It also said two Indian peacekeepers died.\n\nKiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, has accused his former Vice President Riek Machar, a Nuer who was sacked in July, of attempting to seize power by force.\n\nFighting that began on Sunday in the capital Juba has swiftly spread, fuelled by ethnic loyalties.\n\nKiir has said he is ready for dialogue. Machar told French radio that he was ready to \"negotiate his departure from power\" and said the army could force Kiir out if he did not quit.\n\n\"We had a very productive meeting with his excellency President Salva Kiir and we will continue consultations,\" Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom, who is leading African delegation, told reporters before returning to talks.\n\nThe team included ministers from Kenya, Uganda, Djibouti and Somali, and African Union and United Nations representatives. It is the first peace initiative since clashes erupted.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council meets on Friday to discuss South Sudan and to hear a briefing from deputy peacekeeping chief Edmond Mulet.\n\n\"President Kiir has always said that he doesn't want his people to turn back again to war,\" Foreign Minister Barnaba Marial Benjamin told Reuters. \"That is why the government has been negotiating with a lot of militia groups.\"\n\nThe fighting worries neighboring states, who fear new instability in a volatile region of the continent. It threatens the halting steps towards creating a functioning state that declared independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war.\n\nFighting has spread to vital oil areas. Soldiers from the rival factions clashed at a barracks near the town of Bentiu, capital of the oil producing Unity State.\n\nSouth Sudanese officials have said till now that oil production, which had stood at about 245,000 barrels per day and provides most of South Sudan's revenues, have not been affected.\n\nA source in Sudan, which hosts the sole export pipeline, said on Friday there had been no disruption.\n\nETHNIC LOYALTIES\n\nBut 200 oil workers have sought refuge in a U.N. base on Thursday. China National Petroleum Corp, one of the main operators, said it was flying 32 workers out of one field to Juba, according the Chinese state news agency Xinhua.\n\nSouth Sudan's foreign minister and other officials have sought to play down the role of ethnic rifts, blaming political differences. But since fighting moved beyond the capital, clashes have been increasingly driven by ethnic loyalties.\n\n\"So we have a military coup in our hands which is causing a lot of instability in the country and is being played up in certain areas as if it is a racial ethnic war, which is not the case,\" Benjamin said.\n\n\"We don't want to encourage what happened in Rwanda,\" he said, referring to the 1994 genocide there.\n\nThe United Nations said on Tuesday it understood up to 500 people had been killed in clashes but has not given a death toll since then. It says about 34,000 people have fled to bases of the UNMISS peacekeeping mission since fighting started.\n\nClashes in Bor town, where Nuer in 1991 massacred Dinka, have fuelled the fears of an all-out ethnic war. Nuer commander and Machar ally, Peter Gadet, now controls Bor, officials said.\n\nA U.N. official said Luo Nuer youths, from a sub-group of Machar's Nuer ethnic group, had assaulted the Akobo base in Jonglei, saying there were believed to be some deaths.\n\nPresidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told Reuters that 54 people from Kiir's Dinka ethnic group were killed by what he called Machar loyalists in the Akobo raid.\n\nPolitical tensions between the two politicians had been mounting since Kiir, facing growing public frustration about the slow pace of development, sacked Machar.\n\nThe former vice president said he wanted to run for office and accused Kiir of acting like a dictator.\n\nSpeaking to France's RFI radio, Machar said that if Kiir did quit office: \"I think the people will depose him, in particular, influential people in the army.\"\n\nBefore the fighting erupted, Kiir accused his rivals of reviving the kind of splits in the ranks of ruling SPLM party that led to led to bloodshed in 1991. But analysts said he had raised the stakes by branding initial clashes a coup attempt.\n\n(Additional reporting by Drazen Jorgic in Nairobi, Aizu Chen in Singapore, Maggie Fick in Cairo and Lou Charbonneau in New York, Writing by Edmund Blair, Editing by Angus MacSwan)",

Our population statistics according to World Bank is largely made up of young people that's to say over 50 percent is under the age of 18, and 72 percent under the age 30, and that only leaves 10 percent to be under the age of 40-90. With these statistics, one can tell without a doubt that the young generation is generally prone and highly exposed to this lithel virus! The UN agency further accessed that, of people who were under World Health Organisation retroviral programme, only 9 percent has access, and of pregnant women living with Aids only 13 percent has access to services of preventing mother-child tranmission of virus. In re-igniting the fight against HIV/AIDS, the UNAIDS is working with non-governmental partners to stablish HIV/AIDS secretariate and distribute condoms in hospitals and to the military so as to reduce the high rates of HIV/AIDS infection in the country. We can also participate by creating awareness programmes that encourages the youth to abstain/use condom as an alternative, for we can not affort to fight a war with an invisible enemy!

It does not cancel what has been\nagreed upon in the 2012 September 21 proposal\nand Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA),\nsaid Luka Biong Deng, the spokesperson for\nAbyei high referendum committee.\n\"It is to make clear the final status\", he added.\nThe Ngok Dinka community recently declared\ntheir intention to conduct a referendum in the\ndisputed region, after its members agreed\nduring held a general conference in Abyei town\nlast week.\n\nUNACCEPTABLE VOTE\n\nBut the AU commission chair, described as\n\"unacceptable\" and \"irresponsible\" any unilateral\nact in the region, which should have conducted\nits referendum simultaneously with that in\nSouth Sudan in 2011, as per the 2005\nComprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).\n\"This unilateral act is in violation of the relevant\ndecisions of the AU Peace and Security Council\n(PSC), and can only heighten tension on the\nground and further complicate the search for a\nmutually acceptable solution within the\nframework of existing commitments\", the\nchairperson warned.\n\nShe further called on those involved to put a\nhalt to what she described as an \"illegal\" act,\nexpressing concerns about the possible impact\nof the vote on not only relations between the\ntwo Sudans, but the region at large.\nSuch escalation could also put the United\nNations Interim Security Force for Abyei\n(UNISFA) peacekeepers in a very dangerous\nposition, she stressed.\n\nMeanwhile, the AU commission said it\nappreciated South Sudan's rejection of any\nunilateral action in Abyei, and called on the\ninternational community, including the United\nNations, to condemn the \"ongoing unilateral and\nirresponsible action in Abyei, and to prevail\nupon those concerned to cease it immediately\".\n\nLast year, the AU mediation team backed South\nSudan's position, proposing to hold a\nreferendum in Abyei this October in a bid to\nbreak the deadlock over the region.\nHowever, Sudan rejected the proposal, saying it\nignored that the eligibility of the Misseriya and\nthat a public administration and institutions\nmust be established first before any vote can\ntake place.\n\nAt last week's meeting held in Juba, South\nSudan's Salva Kiir and his Sudanese counterpart,\nOmer Hassan Al-Bashir agreed to expedite the\nestablishment of Abyei administration council\nand police organs, and reaffirmed that the 2%\nshare of Abyei areas in oil revenues, including\narrears, will be paid to the Abyei administration.\nYOUR COMMENTS? \nvia: Sudantribune.com\n(san)",

His killers have yet\nto be prosecuted, despite their\narrest.\n\nThe organisation has also called for\nthe release of all nine men arrested\nalong with Sule, urging military and\nsecurity authorities to produce all\nthose who have reported to have\ndisappeared and remain in their\ncustody.\n\nâ¢AKOL INNOCENTâ¢\n\n\"Much as I welcome the decision of\nthe president to pardon those\nmilitia leaders, which is a sign of\npeace and harmony, I do not\nunderstand what crime has Lam Akol\ncommitted for him to be included\",\nsaid a citizen, who spoke on\ncondition of anonymity.\n\n\"The president is being misled.\nBeing in opposition does not amount\nto rebellion\", he added.\n\nSimon Deng, a native of Jonglei\nbased in Juba said he was still not\naware of what charges Akol was\nbeing pardoned for.\n\n\"I have never heard what he was\naccused of. I thought he was only\nbeing criticised for staying in\nKhartoum. \n\nIs the pardon for having\nbeen self-exiled, or what? I do not\nunderstand. What really has [he]\ndone? said Deng.\n\nAkol, a former member of the\ngoverning Sudan People's Liberation\nMovement (SPLM), previously served\nas Sudan's minister of foreign affairs\nfrom 2005 to October 2007 under the\nComprehensive Peace Agreement\n(CPA) signed in 2005.\n\nIn 2010, he unsuccessfully\nchallenged Kiir for the presidency,\ngarnering only 7% of votes in an\nelection which he claimed was highly\nflawed in favour of the incumbent.\n\nYour views in comment?\n(ssn)",

billion pounds (SDG) this year from fees charged on exports of South Sudan oil through Sudan's pipelines.\n\nOmer asserted that these figures prove that the government does not actually subsidize fuel prices.\n\nHe accused the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) of being indifferent with regard to the economic crisis in order to clinch to power at the expense of the Sudanese people, adding that the increase in the dollar exchange rate for customs purposes from 4 to 6 pounds had an adverse effect on the prices of the basic commodities.\n\nThe opposition figure downplayed the impact of the consultations held by the finance minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel-Rasool with the political forces in order to rally support for the decision to lift subsidies, pointing that the minster's efforts in this regard proved futile.\n\nHe further pointed that the government is facing a serious crisis due to the budget failure and the expansion in security spending, predicting that the parliament will receive and approve and the decision to lift subsidies with \"clapping\".\n\nIn a related issue, the opposition Popular Congress Part (PCP) accused the government of misleading the public by publishing false reports about economic growth figures over the past years.\n\nThe PCP urged the government to declare its failure and abandon power and declared its rejection to lifting subsidies.\n\nThe PCP's Secretary General assistant for Economic Affairs, Hassan Sati, said that the government reached an impasse and explained that the Sudanese economy is facing what he described as an inflationary recession due to the decline in production and rising prices.\n\nSati said that the only way for emerging from the economic crisis is conditional upon regime change, saying that the government lost the trust of the international financing institutions.\n\nThe PCP official described this year's budget as \"weak\" and said that its deficit ratio reached 12% and that public revenues cover only 40% of the public expenditure which forces the government to borrow the remaining 60% to cover the deficit.\n\nSati emphasized that the government does not have a vision to overcome the economic crisis and added that lifting subsidies will not help unless the government injects money into the budget.\n\n\"Over the past years, the government sought to withdraw money from the economy instead of injecting money into it,\" he said.\n\nHe criticized the government for spending millions of US dollars in arms purchases while the economy suffers from clear imbalances.\n\nSati warned against total dependence on the imports of basic goods and lack of interest in domestic production and considered it a serious threat to Sudan's food security, holding the government responsible for what he described as the \"dire economic situation\".\n\nHe said that Khartoum is paying the price for its wrong policies and predicted that the crisis would further exacerbate, describing the government tripartite economic program as \"ink on a paper\".\n\nThe tripartite program was meant to help Sudan cope with the impact of losing most of the country's oil after South Sudan secession in July 2011.\n\nBy contrast, the head of the parliamentary subcommittee on Economic Affairs, Omer al-Amin, said that the 2014 budget is promising and will meet the basic needs of the people.\n\nHe declined to comment on the government's decision to lift fuel subsidies, saying that he just arrived from Lebanon where he attended a training course on how to create a realistic budget.\n\nThe opposition Sudanese Communist Party (SCP) also announced its rejection to lifting fuel and goods subsidies calling upon Sudanese people to resist it through the various kinds of mass struggle.\n\nThe SCP spokesperson, Youssef Hussein, said in a press release on Monday, that the presidential assistant Abdel-Rahman al-Mahdi and the financial minister, Ali Mahmoud Abdel-Rasool, asked for a meeting with the SCP leadership to discuss the matter.\n\n\"We accepted to meet with them and we set a date for the meeting in our party's headquarter\", Hussein said.\n\nHussein said that the government request for meeting with the SCP coincides with its implementation of the decision to lift subsidies, noting that an unannounced increase in customs duties has already begun.\n\nHussein said that the government does not grant subsidies, accusing it of seeking to hold the opposition forces responsible for its failed policies including the destruction of the economy pillars and secession of South Sudan.\n\nHe complained that the government spends 70% of its budget on security and military in order to protect the regime, accusing it of demanding the Sudanese people to bear the cost of their own suppression and starvation.\n\nThe leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Mohamed Osman Al-Mirghani, instructed his party's organs to form a committee to study the government's anticipated decision calling upon the committee to conduct its work in accordance with principle of alleviating the suffering of the citizens.\n\nAccording to a press statement issued by Al-Mirghani's office on Monday, the committee submit its recommendations to the party leader to make the decision which serves the interest of the nation and citizens.\n\nSudan lost 75% of its oil reserves after the southern part of the country became an independent nation in July 2011 denying the north billions of dollars in revenues.\n\nPrior to the country's breakup, Sudan produced close to 500,000 barrels but now its output is limited to 140,000 barrels per day. Oil revenue constituted more than half of the Sudan's revenue and 90% of its exports.\n\nFollowing the independence of South Sudan in July 2011, Khartoum was forced to introduce a contractionary budget that saw the partial lifting of fuel and food subsidies which triggered rare but small demonstrations across the country.\n\nThe government defended the measures saying that the country can no longer afford to pay for these subsidies.\n\n[ssn]",

    "status_message": "A Sudanese jet fighter has bombed a military barracks in South Sudan's Unity state on Saturday, killing a South Sudanese army (SPLA) soldier and his wife.\n\nSPLA officials have blamed the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) for several recent provocative attacks inside their territory, despite peace effort by the African Union (AU)-led Joint Border Verification and Monitoring team (JBVMT).\n\nSix other people, including a four-year-old girl, were reportedly injured in Saturday's attack in Jau and are now seeking medical treatment in Rubkotna.\n\nThe unilateral attack followed bilateral talks between the leaders of Sudan and South Sudan in Khartoum last week, in which they expressed the need to strengthen relations between the two countries.\n\nSPLA commander of Unity state's fourth division, Major Gen. James Koang Chuol, confirmed on Sunday that a woman and her husband had died during the bombing of the SPLA military base in the Jau area.\n\nHe condemned the actions of the SAF, describing the attack, which occurred about 11:40am, as an unfortunate decision.\n\nKoang said the incident was without provocation and occurred as high ranking officers from both countries were holding negotiations in the Unity capital, Bentiu.\n\nThe senior military officials from the SAF and SPLA general headquarters were reportedly sent to Jau to verify SAF claims that SPLA forces had failed to withdraw from the 10km buffer zone.\n\nThe team, who are still being hosted in Bentiu by the SPLA, travelled to the area by helicopter to investigate the claims.\n\nKoang said the latest bombardments by the SAF are a betrayal of ongoing talks between leaders from both nations, as well as AU peace efforts in the region.\n\nIn Khartoum, the Sudanese army remained silent, and SAF spokesperson was not reachable to verify these claims.\n\nIn the past, the Sudanese army justified such air raids by saying that Sudanese rebel groups use the disputed border areas to prepare attacks on its troops. Some times also SAF said the bombing occurred inside the Sundanese territory.\n\nIn August, northern forces were accused of allegedly shooting SPLA soldiers on patrol along the disputed border area.\n\nThe clash reportedly occurred after SPLA forces witnessed their northern counterparts digging up more oil wells in Tachuin, resulting into unilateral fire exchange between the two armies.\n\nThere remains scepticism about the status and implementation of security agreements aimed at defusing tensions along the common border of both Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nHeglig, which is located at 23 km from Unity state and lies near the border between the two countries, has been the scene of ongoing clashes.\n\nAlthough the area is claimed by South Sudan, the AU mediation team has refused to recognise it as a disputed area.\n\nIn April 2012, the SPLA seized control of the oil-producing area, but withdrew its troops 10 days later amid fears of an all-out war between the two sides.\n\nDuring the recent bilateral talks in Khartoum, South Sudanese president Salva Kiir and his Sudanese counterpart, Omer Hassan al-Bashir, reaffirmed their commitment to develop cross-border trading and continue oil flows from landlocked South Sudan to international markets via Sudanese pipelines.\n\nssn",

    "status_message": "May 4, 2013 (JUBA)- Kuol Deng Kuol, the paramount chief of the Nine Ngok Dinka of the disputed border region of Abyei has been killed in an ambush, officials here said today.\n\nEdward Lino, the Co-Chair of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee (AJOC), representing South Sudan said that chief Kuol, among others, were shot dead in an ambush by members of the rival Arabs nomads of Misseriya while they were in a convoy belonging to the United Nations Interim Force for Abyei (UNISFA) on their way back to Abyei town from a visit north of the area.\n\n\"The paramount chief Kuol Deng Kuol known as Kuol Adol in the area has been killed today in Abyei by the members of the Misseriya. He was part of my team which went to Abyei yesterday to hold a meeting with Sudanese delegation and after the meeting they visited Kej (Difra)\" Lino told South Sudan News.\n\n\"You know Kej which they call Difra, literally meaning push away which clearly tells you that the area was inhibited by some people who are being pushed away, is where the oil is produced in Abyei which the government of Sudan is exploiting\", Lino added.\n\n\"As part of my team he went together with Sudanese delegation and they toured the area after talks, then the Sudanese delegation left to Muglad after concluding the visit and our team started returning to Abyei but they fell into an ambush on their way by members of the Misseriya who asked UNISFA force to surrender them. They started negotiating for release. This happened at around 1:00PM to 2:00PM when they were stopped and the negotiations went on until 6:00PM when they finally opened fire on the convoy and the chief was killed with others\", the South Sudanese official explained.\n\nHe said the team had Deng Mading Mijak who is his deputy and Maguith Deng who is a senior member of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee and the late paramount Chief Kuol Deng Kuol.\n\nThere were also other members from the area who were being escorted by UNISFA . They were together with Force Commander and his team.\n\nJuac Agok, the deputy Chairperson of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) in the area also confirmed the incident, describing the killing as what the international community had wanted to happen first in the area before they could begin to take seriously what they warned about Khartoum seeking to sabotage conduct of the referendum in the area.\n\n\"They have killed the chief. Our paramount chief has now been confirmed dead. There are also some people but I do not know how many. I have heard of three people but it could be more because they were in a convoy. I think this was what the international community had wanted to hear first. The international community never showed any interest in resolving the conflict of Abyei. They wanted the people of Abyei to be wiped out as this is the policy of the government of Sudan\" Agok said.\n\n\"We have been saying that the government of Sudan did not withdraw forces from Abyei and it is openly arming Misseriya tribes. The international community is always quick to condemn and put pressure on the government of South Sudan but does nothing when Sudan violates and defies directives of the African Union and Security Council of the United Nations\", the emotionally charged official told SouthSudan News Saturday.\n\nSouth Sudan's Minister of Cabinet Affairs, Deng Alor Kuol. who is also from the area and is a relative of the deceased paramount chief, said his government will hold the government of Sudan responsible for the killing because the incident shows that Khartoum armed the Misseriya members and sent them to the area \"to carry out terrorist-like activities\".\n\n\"It is with deep regret that I inform you of the death of our paramount chief Kuol Adol. He was killed this evening in an ambush by Misseriya. The government of Sudan will definitely pay for his death and those who have died with him. This is clear act of terrorism and Khartoum must not be allowed to get away with it like other atrocities it had committed in the area before\", Alor told weeping family members who gathered in his house after learning the incident on Saturday.\n\nSouth Sudan's Inspector General of Police, Pieng Deng Kuol, said \"armed activities of the government of Sudan in the area were no longer bearable\" before collapsing, indicating the level of anger generated by the incident within the community.\n\nKuol Deng, a senior civil servant in the Abyei said the killing of the paramount chief of the area was an organised plan by the government of Sudan because it happened after its delegation left.\n\n\"There should be no guesswork as to who is behind this incident. The killing of our chief and those who have died with him today was an organised plan. The government of Sudan knows it. You can see that it happened just after the Sudanese delegation left the area. The delegation knew it well. They knew even the time the plan would be carried out. This is clear terrorist work\", Deng told South Sudan News\n\nThe United Nations Interim Force for Abyei did not respond to a call by Sudan Tribune on Saturday and there was no immediate official release by the government South Sudan.\n\nA Misseriya chief speaking to Agence France Presse (AFP) also confirmed the death, saying Kuol \"was killed today\" but accused UNISFA of provoking the clash.\n\n\"A group of Misseriya stopped the convoy and started negotiations. Then a clash happened when a UNISFA soldier shot one of the Misseriya who was readying his weapon,\" said the Misseriya chief who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nDuring the resulting clash, \"the Dinka leader's car was hit by an explosion and he and his driver were killed\".\n\nAnother anonymous resident told AFP that the Misseriya wanted to know why a Dinka was being taken through their zone, and negotiations \"continued for a long time\".\n\nAt some point gunfire broke out, \"and they shot the car of the Dinka chief\", he added, without specifying who opened fire.\n\nIn New York the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon issued a statement condemning the assassination of Kuol.\n\n\"The Secretary-General strongly condemns the killing of the Ngok Dinka Paramount Chief Deng Kuol Deng and a UNISFA peacekeeper in an attack by a Misseriya assailant on a UNISFA convoy in the Abyei Area, today. Two peacekeepers were also seriously wounded in the incident\" said the statement.\n\nHe urged Khartoum, Juba, Ngok Dinka and Misseriya communities \"to remain calm and avoid any escalation of this unfortunate event\".\n\n\"This proves again how crucially important it is for the two Governments to establish the temporary institutions as stipulated in the 20 June 2011 Agreement and continue discussions on the final status of the Abyei Area\" Ban said.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Ambassador to South Sudan condemned the May 4 attack that killed Kuol and a United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) Ethiopian peacekeeper.\n\n\"The U.S. Government strongly condemns this act of violence and demands that those responsible be held accountable. We urge the governments of South Sudan and Sudan to exercise restraint during this sensitive and volatile period,\" Susan Page said in a statement extended to  SouthSudan news.\n\nWe appeal for calm in Abyei and implore all sides to avoid further escalation of violence, she added.\n\nThe US envoy urged the parties to the conflict in Abyei to use the mechanisms, namely the Joint Security Committee, which they have put in place, to investigate these acts of violence and to facilitate a transparent and effective investigation to bring those responsible to justice and to ensure this tragic incident does not escalate into further violence.\n\n\"We especially urge all parties to cooperate fully in the investigation,\" she stressed.\n\nAbyei was scheduled to have a referendum in January 2011 to decide its fate but it never took place as Khartoum and Juba disagreed on who should be able to participate.\n\nLast year, the African Union mediation team proposed that a referendum be held in the contested region this October, but that only those residing permanently in the area would be allowed to vote in the plebiscite, and decide whether they want to join Sudan or South Sudan.\n\nThis proposal would effectively make the majority of voters come from the Dinka Ngok tribe, aligned with South Sudan, thus putting the Arab Misseriya nomads, who spend several months in Abyei every year grazing, not part of the voting.\n\nAccording to the mediators, exclusion of the Misseriya nomads, in line with the decision of the Hague-based arbitration court, which defined the territory of the nine Ngok Dinka chiefdoms in July 2009.\n\nHowever, Sudan swiftly rejected the plan, which received the blessing of the AU Peace and Security Council (AUPSC)\n\n(SSN)",
