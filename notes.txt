//BACK END

Organize data by number of likes (decending ).


/ GET REQUEST THE FACEBOOK GRAPH API FB FEED OF THE PAGE
/ GET THE COMMENTS BY USING THE GRAPH LINES FROM FBS SITE
/ THE CONTENTS OF THOSE WILL BE AN ARRAY OF JSON OBJECTS WHICH CONTAIN THE SHIT

PROCEED WITH WHAT I WAS ALREADY WORKING ON - ARRANGING BY LIKE COUNT - ARRANGING BY DATE AND TIME ETC.
THEN CODE THE HTML FOR A SET OF FILTERS AND BUTTONS WHICH ACTIVATE THOSE JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS AND TOOLS
CSS IT PRETTY
LEAVE A MAIN DIV WHICH CAN JUST HOLD THE PROCESSING VIZ
USE PROCESSING TO TAKE THE VALUE'S OF THE DATA PARTS (SORT OUT HOW THIS WORKS EXACTLY..)
AND PUT THOSE VALUES INTO THE HEIGHT, WIDTH, COLOR, SHAPE TYPE ETC OF THE VIZ ELEMENTS
THEN I HAVE A NICE WEB APP FOR VIZZING THE INTERACTIONS OF A SOUTH SUDANESE 'NEWS' FACEBOOK PAGE
(this should update every few minutes maybe? or have a refresh button)

LOG OF PROGRESS:
22/02/2017 - THE SCRAPER WORKS CORRECTLY TO HTTP GET THE GRAPH API DATA FOR FB PAGE,
  IT THEN PRINTS THIS ALL TO CONSOLE AND AS THIS IS RUNNING SERVER SIDE PRINTS TO TERMINAL.
  I NEED THIS DATA TO BE MADE available CLIENT SIDE FRONT END FOR MANIPULATION.

  to get data for each post on page. loop for each ID point in array, object ; put that ID into a string url(s) and request that.

23/02/2017 - I NOW HAVE A WEB SERVER (SO THE TOOL CAN RUN LOCALLY WITHOUT A TERMINAL PYTHON SERVER) AND THE TOOL NOW SCRAPES THE FACEBOOK PAGE USING PYTHON,
  SAVES AS CSV, REWRITES TO JSON AND NOW IT'S READY TO BE PICKED AT USING KEYS TO EXTRACT THE VALUES FOR INSERTION INTO SVG VARIABLES TO GRAPHICALLY REPRESENT THEM

CONSIDER THE AESTHETICS NOW. IT'S A 'LIVE VISUALIZATION OF A SOUTH SUDANESE FACEBOOK NEWS PAGE'.
WHAT SHOULD IT SHOW?
EACH POST AS A SHAPE, AND THEN WHAT EFFECT IT HAD RIPPLED AROUND IT. COULD WORK OUT A REPRESENTATION OF EACH POST BY CHARACTER LENGTH OVERALL, ADN USE THIS
AS A PIXEL COUNT. HAVE MORE PIXELS FOR BIGGER POSTS, LESS FOR SMALLER POSTS, THE POST PIXELS ARE BLUE FOR FACEBOOK, THEN THE REACTIONS ARE DIFFERENT COLORS BASED ON
EMOTION COLOR THEORY. SHOWS HOW BINARY ISN'T ALWAYS BLACK AND WHITE. BECOMES A SOCIAL EMOTIONAL HEAT MAP OF PIXELS.

ANOTHER IDEA RELATED TO THE COLORS AND THEN PIXELS AND SIZE -- MAKE THE POST SHAPE THE COLOR OF THE MOST REACTIONS IT RECEIVED; I.E; 5 ANGRY = RED ETC ??
SO ZOOMED OUT THE PREDOMINANT THEME IS VISIBLE.

A SOCIAL EMOTIONAL HEAT MAP OF SOUTH SUDAN SOCIAL MEDIA (ON ONE FACEBOOK PAGE)

SHOULD ALLOW FOR USER INTERACTION. WHAT KIND?
ZOOMING - ENABLE MORE INFORMATION ON THE POST ON TOUCH
FILTERING - BY POST LIKES, REACTION TYPE, MOST REACTIONS

I COULD REALLY EASILY DESIGN THIS FOR MOBILE DEVICES. WOULD BE EASIER FOR TOUCH AND NICER TO SHOW.
EASY SHARE BUTTON OR FEATURE WOULD BE GOOD TOO.

PROCESSING HAS AN ANDROID DEVELOPMENT THINGY. INVESTIGATE OPTIONS FOR MOBILE VIZ AND WHETHER ANY OF IT IS SUPPORTED OR BREAKS THINGS.

IF I DO THAT I NEED TO CONSIDER LOADING TIMES TOO. IF IT TAKES LONG TO LOAD - USE NICE FEEDBACK SCREEN WITH GIF OR % DONE

ALSO DO CLEVER JQUERY BITS TO LOAD EVERYTHING FIRST AND THEN EXECUTE ALL AT ONCE.
