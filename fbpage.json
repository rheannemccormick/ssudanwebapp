The law aims to hinder armed groups from using minerals to finance conflicts.\n\"It's a very high compliance refinery. We do due diligence for every customer who comes in,\" Alain Goetz, the chief executive officer of Africa Gold Refinery (AGR), told Reuters.\nGoetz is AGR's majority shareholder and he also owns a stake in Belgian gold refiner Tony Goetz NV.\nHe said AGR would carefully select its customers, comply with the law and label its gold accordingly.\n\"Of course we want to sell to American companies, we will sell to American companies. With the compliance and the third party auditing, we'll comply with all the regulations ... including labelling,\" Goetz said.\nUganda has been keen to attract investors to its mining sector after government surveys established the existence of minerals including gold, base metals, uranium, rare earths, iron, titanium, vermiculite, diamond in various locations.\nThe factory has an initial output capacity of 300 kilogrammes of pure gold per week, and the ability to increase that to 500 kilograms eventually. Goetz said the gold will be used for coins and jewellery.\nBetween mid-2009 and mid-2015, Uganda's annual gold exports fluctuated between near zero to just under $40 million, according to central bank data.\nExports rocketed to $204 million in the last financial year, ended in July 2016. Boden said the sudden jump could be due in part to gold smuggled from neighbouring countries and being exported from Uganda.

As a citizen of this nation, I have all the privileges and rights to express my views and opinions on anything that may concern South Sudan in accordance to the federal constitution of the Republic Of South Sudan (Justice, liberty and prosperity for ALL, See South Sudan eagle logo for quick reference). Therefore in my own opinion on the wiretap to the current development in South Sudan city's relocation from Juba to Ramciel is a great idea, I have always wanted and demanded it. I'm so pleased that it has been brought to table recently. The location of Ramciel in the hub of South Sudan and Africa in a large extent do give all citizens of South Sudan that it may concern to clamor and claim it to be the next city of South Sudan and Africa's business hub with out any kind of skepticism. The only sceptics I knew would be 'how South Sudan government will manage to meet the sum of monies needed to build the brand new city Modernly'. On the other transparency, I do see that as something miner and can be well solved by requesting an indebted from China, US, or world bank, you mention it. Besides that, is security concern, the insecurity in the country is still proliferating to a higher rate (outside Juba) in a every single day. How about if we could met security stability first? Before we could transfer to Ramciel?. In a few words conclusion, it will be one among the great ideas from the people of South Sudan especially, H.E Mr. President Gen. Kiir.
